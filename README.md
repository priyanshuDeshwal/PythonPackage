# PythonPackage

This is a Python package that contains a collection of useful functions and classes for working with data.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```
pip install python-package
```

## Usage

To use the package, import it into your Python script:

```python
import python_package
```

You can then use the functions and classes in the package to work with data. For example, to read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, you can use the following code:

```python
import python_package
df = python_package.read_csv('data.csv')
```

## Functions

The package contains the following functions:

* `read_csv()`: Reads a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
* `write_csv()`: Writes a pandas DataFrame to a CSV file.
* `clean_data()`: Cleans a pandas DataFrame by removing duplicate rows, null values, and outliers.
* `normalize_data()`: Normalizes a pandas DataFrame by scaling the values to be between 0 and 1.
* `split_data()`: Splits a pandas DataFrame into training and testing sets.

## Classes

The package contains the following classes:

* `DataTransformer`: A class that transforms data using a series of transformations.
* `ModelTrainer`: A class that trains a machine learning model.
* `ModelEvaluator`: A class that evaluates the performance of a machine learning model.

## Example

The following code shows how to use the package to train and evaluate a machine learning model:

```python
import python_package

# Load the data
data = python_package.read_csv('data.csv')

# Clean the data
data = python_package.clean_data(data)

# Normalize the data
data = python_package.normalize_data(data)

# Split the data
train_data, test_data = python_package.split_data(data)

# Train the model
model = python_package.ModelTrainer().train(train_data)

# Evaluate the model
score = python_package.ModelEvaluator().evaluate(model, test_data)

# Print the score
print(score)
```
